GitHub is definitely a platform that helps us work in a more organized way and without the fear of losing or deleting past work. 
I had heard about this platform for a while but had never really dived into it before.
Through this class, I have learned the basics of repositories,commits and pull requests. 
While I am still trying to get the pace, I believe I will get to that point as the course progresses, and I am eager to continue learning in more detail.
